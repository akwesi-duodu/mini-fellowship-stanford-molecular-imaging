# mini-fellowship-stanford-molecular-imaging
Repository for projects, code, and resources from the Stanford [Year] Mini-Fellowship in Advanced Molecular Imaging.
Overview
This repository hosts computational tools, scripts, and documentation developed during the Stanford Mini-Fellowship on Molecular Imaging Techniques, covering:

PET/SPECT & MRI tracer development

Quantitative image analysis (e.g., kinetic modeling, segmentation)

Machine learning applications in molecular imaging

Open-source datasets and pipelines for reproducibility

Key Topics
ðŸ”¬ Imaging Modalities:

Radiotracer design (e.g., FDG, Ga-68 DOTATATE)

Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI

Multimodal registration (PET-MRI/CT)

Appplications of imaging with machine learning anf AI 

ðŸ’» Computational Tools:

Python/MATLAB scripts for time-activity curve (TAC) analysis

OSEM reconstruction for PET data

Deep learning models (e.g., CNN-based tumor segmentation)
